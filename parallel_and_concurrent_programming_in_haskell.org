* Concurrency and Parallelism
*Parallel program* uses a multiplicity of hardware to perform a computation more quickly: *to arrive at the answer earlier*.
Alternatives: better algorithm, lower quality, better hardware.

*Concurrency*: program-structuring technique in which there are *multiple threads of control* to
*interact with multiple independent external agents*.
Conceptually, threads run at the same time whether they actually execute at the same time is an implementation detail.
Alternatives: event loops, callbacks.
\\

*Detetrministic* programming model: a program can give only one result.

*Non-deterministic* programming model: a program may have many results.
\\

*Concurrent* programming models are necessarily *non-deterministic*. They interact with external agents that cause events at unpredictable times.
Most *parallel* programming models can be deterministic. Exceptions:
 - some algorithms depend on internal non-determinism
 - when you want to parallelize programs that do have side effects
\\

*In Haskell*, concurrency (in general) is a structuring technique for effectful code.
Pure code has no effects to observe & evaluation order doesn't matter.
